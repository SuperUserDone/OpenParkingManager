This project is an attempt to create a free and open source system to find your vehicles parked at a shopping mall, airport or other closed parking. The problem this tries to solve is people losing their vehicle in large parking areas.This project also implements basic parking management functions like:
- Locating of vehicle
- Entry
- Tracking
- Payment (Representation)
- SQL database

Some features we plan to implement:
- Mobile Application
- Management Application

**Currently this project is not fit for use in a real world scenario.**
